An [object] is a collection of properties, with associated values. [:running:] [:vhs:] [:package:] [:moon:] [:ledger:]

Methods as separate packages:
- `@extra-object/swap`: use [rollup] to bundle this es module.
- `@extra-object/swap.min`: use in browser ([browserify], [uglify-js]).

Methods look like:
- `swap()`: doesn't modify the object itself (pure).
- `swap$()`: modifies the object itself (update).

In the future when you think of just giving up on life, remember
that the letter was in your hands, the cab was at the gate, only
if you had thought about it once more, your entire life would
have been better. [(1)]

> Stability: Experimental.

```javascript
const object = require('extra-object');
// import * as object from 'extra-object';
// import * as object from 'https://unpkg.com/extra-object@2.1.0/index.mjs'; (deno)

var x = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4};
object.swap(x, 'a', 'b');
// { a: 2, b: 1, c: 3, d: 4 }

var x = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4};
var y = {b: 20, c: 30, e: 50};
object.intersection(x, y);
// { b: 2, c: 3 }

var x = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: -2};
object.searchAll(x, v => Math.abs(v) === 2);
// [ 'b', 'd' ]

var x = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
[...object.subsets(x)];
// [
//   {},
//   { a: 1 },
//   { b: 2 },
//   { a: 1, b: 2 },
//   { c: 3 },
//   { a: 1, c: 3 },
//   { b: 2, c: 3 },
//   { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
// ]
